Welcome to pyrotd's documentation!
==================================

Simple Python functions for calculating psuedo-spectral acceleration and
rotated psuedo-spectral acceleration. The response of the
single-degree-of-freedom oscillator is computed in the frequency domain along
with frequency-domain interpolation to accurately capture the high-frequency
characteristics.
